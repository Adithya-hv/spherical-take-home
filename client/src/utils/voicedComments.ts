      "(In Tamil): I've spent most of my life in Hiranandani (An Apartment Complex). It used to be full of greenery, surrounded by trees and forests. But now things have changed. The moment you step outside, the air feels polluted, and even the water is dirty. Trash is being burned openly everywhere—dry leaves, plastic, everything going up in smoke. Trees are being cut down every day, and constant construction adds to the noise and dust all around. 8-10 years ago, this place was completely different—peaceful, green, and clean. Now it\’s all slowly getting worse. I\’m trying to bring some change, but it gets even harder when the people around you don\’t seem to care about the environment.",
